Set your activity types
-----------------------
A number of generic activities types are available by default in Odoo (e.g. call, email, meeting, etc.). If you would like to set new ones, go to ``Settings / General settings / Activity types``.

Schedule meetings
-----------------
Activities are planned for specific days. If you need to set hours, go with the Meeting activity type. When scheduling one, the calendar will simply open to let you select a time slot.
